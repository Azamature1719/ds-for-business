- Oversmoothing
- Underestimation
5. Which algorithm is designed to solve binary classification problem
- K-means
- **Logistic regression**

6. As a part of the analytical department of a marketplace company you have collected data of 1,000,000 users behaviour on the website to improve the current recommender system. In the context of machine learning, what would you call this data?
- Big data
- **Training set**
- Machine learning 
- Bootstrap sample
7. Which of the following algorithms are not a supervised ones:
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- **Principal Component Analysis**
- **Hierarchical clustering**
8. As a member of the data analysis department of the bank you need to predict the account balance (by the end of the month) of the bank's clients. Which algorithm is better suited to solve this task?
- Random Forest classification
- Logistic Regression
 -**Gradient Boosting Regression**
- K nearest neighbours classification
9. How increasing the depth of the decision tree affects the algorithm?
- Increase bias, increase variance
- Decrease bias, decrease variance
- Increase bias, decrease variance
- **Decrease bias, increase variance**
10. You have computed ROC AUC score of a machine learning model and obtain result of 0.5, which means that
- **Your model is no better than random guessing**
- Your model is accurate in 50% of the cases
- Your model detects 50% of True Negatives
- Probability threshold of the most accurate model is 0.5
11. You want to increase number of True Positives outputted by a classification algorithm, for that you need to
- Increase probability threshold
- **Decrease probability threshold**
- Subtract outputted probabilities from 1
- Calibrate probabilities
12. Data scientists from your team decide to use the K nearest neighbour algorithm with K=30. You argue that these could lead to
- **Solution with high bias and low variance**
- Need to increase the size of the training data set
- Noisy predictions
- Increasing model complexity
13. In order to optimise storage facility maximum capacity and keep all products in stock you are predicting a demand for different types of products. What term does better explain this task
- **Time-series analysis**
- Customers segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Personalised recommendations
14. KFold is an alternative method to
- K-Means
- KNN

- AlphaFold
15. You solve a spam classification task, what metrics are more appropriate to assess the quality of the resulting algorithm?
- Accuracy score
- **ROC AUC**
- Mean squared logarithmic error
- R squared
16. The terms “elbow method”, “single/complete linkage”, “centroid”, “dendrogram” are referring to what kind of methods?
- Classification
- Regression
- Dimensionality reduction
- **Clustering**
17. You are designing a recommender system on a marketplace website. Your goal is to propose an algorithm to suggest items which are frequently bought with currently observed item. What kind of algorithm is better suited for this task?
- **Association rules (Apriori)**
- Matrix decomposition
- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
18. Select all correct statements about Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Principle components are a linear combination of data features**
- The goal of PCA is to reconstruct new independent components
- PCA is always good for visualisation on a 2D plain
- **One needs to specify number of principal components**
19. In order to decide the best position of a new offline retail market you cluster geometrical locations of nearby residential buildings. You expect them to form clusters of many different sizes and shapes. Which of the following methods is the most appropriate?
- K-Means
- **Density based (DBSCAN)**
- Hierarchical clustering
- TSNE
20. The goal of A/B testing is to
- **Accurately measure the effect of a newly proposed feature/algorithm** 
- Evaluate the quality of a trained (on group A) algorithm on a separate independent data subset (group B)
- Decrease the variance of the present solution by applying it independently into two clustered subgroups
- Test hypothesis B against an alternative A and decide which one is better
